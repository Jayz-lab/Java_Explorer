        /*
        This code uses a "switch" statement to determine the value of the "size" field of an object "c1" based on the value of the "measurement" variable.
        The "switch" statement compares the value of the "measurement" variable with the values of the "case" statements. 
        If the value of "measurement" matches any of the values of the first case statement (1,2,3), the c1.size will be "S", 
        if the value of "measurement" matches any of the values of the second case statement (4,5,6), the c1.size will be "M", 
        if the value of "measurement" matches any of the values of the third case statement (7,8,9), the c1.size will be "L", 
        and if the value of "measurement" does not match any of the values in the case statements, the value of c1.size will be set to "X" by the default case statement.
        The "break" statement at the end of each case block is used to exit the switch statement once a match has been found. 
        This way, the code execution doesn't continue to the next case statement.

//Types of loops
//A 'While' loop, repeats while a Boolean expression is true.(not covered in Java Explorer)
//A 'do/while' loop, executes at least once.(not covered in Java Explorer)
//A 'for' loop simply repeats a set number of times. 
//A 'for each' is the enhanced 'for' loop, which automatically iterates through a collection of values. ie. an Array.(collection of values)
